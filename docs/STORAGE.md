# Future-proofing:

Ridiculous as it seems now, any serious future-proofing effort should require including entire copies of relevant source code, the more critical ones in plain-text with appropriate font. At a minimum, the ColorSafe spec should be included in plain-text, and the cslib.py file should be included as well. Of secondary concern is the encoder and recognition files, which can technically be derived completely from spec, and/or generate file. Then ColorSafe encoded copies of all relevant dependencies should be included, such as tar/gz source.

# Archiving:
Derived from research by Wilhelm Imaging Research, here are some suggestions for optimal storage to prevent smudging or distortion:

* Container
  * Waterproof, rigid, archival-grade plastic container
  * Opaque container, or stored in darkness
  * Silica gel packets included
  * Stored in a freezer (at 0C) 
* Paper
  * Acid-free
  * Archival-grade ink
* Printing
  * High quality or slow
  * ~50% spacing between dots
* Handling
  * Not handled with bare hands or on a dirty surface
  * Set out to dry for at least 24 hours before stacking
  * Re-encoded and checked from time to time
