# ColorSafe

A colorized data storage scheme for printing on paper for archival purposes. Inspired by [PaperBak](https://github.com/Rupan/paperbak), ColorSafe is written with modern methods and technologies, is well-documented, and cross-platform. It aims to allow a few Megabytes of data (or more) to be stored on paper for a worst case scenario backup, for extremely long-term archiving, or just for fun. It's written in a simplistic fashion that, with best practices, can allow data to safely withstand the viccissitudes of technology changes over a long period of time.
